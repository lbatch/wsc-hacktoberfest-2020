### Pull request? What?

Git is the version control system (VCS) that teams use to track the history of changes on a collaborative project. It lets teams working on open source and other team coding projects manage changes, recover old versions, and prevent conflicting changes when collaborating on the same codebase. If you're new to git or need a refresher, letting us know you're participating in Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity to brush up on your git skills before opening your first open source PR!
